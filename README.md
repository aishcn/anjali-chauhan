### Hi there, I'm Anjali 👋🏽

I am a Senior at UBC majoring in Statistics 📊

You can reach me via [email](mailto:anjalivschauhan@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20there!) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjalischauhan/). To check out a list of projects that I've been working on: [anjali-chauhan.github.io](https://anjali-chauhan.github.io)

I major in Statistics because I love to get creative and challenged with data, and the projects I work on could potentially impact millions of people around the globe. I'm currently interning at [Royal Bank Of Canada](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more about my experience or any of the projects I've worked on. I'd love to chat ✨
